As a general rule I don't post Acked-by/Reviewed-by tags for patches
that are targeting a subsystem that I maintain.  The logic being that
I'm going to be adding my Signed-off-by tag to the patches and arguing
these in front of Linus, so adding a Acked-by/Reviewed-by simply
creates more work later on where I have to strip them off and replace
them with my sign-off.

If the lack of a Reviewed-by tag is *really* what is preventing you
from reviewing the fs-verity patch, I can post that starting with the
next revision, but I'm guessing the lack of my tag isn't your core
issue (or at least I would argue it shouldn't be).

Considering the current state of this patchset I don't believe that
verdict to be fair, or very considerate.

We clearly have different styles and approaches towards subsystem
maintainer roles.  I've had the good fortune to work with both hostile
and helpful senior developers during the early years of my time
working in the Linux kernel, and it helped reinforce the impact
patience and mentoring can have on contributors who are new to the
Linux kernel or perhaps system programming in general.  While I'm far
from perfect in this regard, I do hope and recommend that all of us in
maintainer, or senior developer, roles remember to exercise some
additional patience and education when working with new contributors.
